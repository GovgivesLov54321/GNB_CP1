# GNB - 1st - ☑️ Strings Notes

#A string is a collection of symbols held together by quotation marks

sentence = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog!"

first_name = "Tio"
mes = "Septeimbre"
libro = "The Big, Bad Wolf"
comida = "papas fritas"

print(mes)

#Called strings because

#Make one by

#We use strings because

#It doesn't matter if I use single or double quotes

#An escape character is

#print(""Sigma"is so alpha") #No bueno
print("'Sigma' is so alpha") #Bueno
print('"Sigma" is so alpha') #Bueno

print("\"Sigma\" is so alpha") #escape character

#We get the length of our string by 

print(len(sentence)) #length of string (amount of characters; includes spaces)

#We concatanate strings by doing:

last_name = "Alpha"
full_name = first_name + last_name

print(full_name)

#I slice a string by
print(mes[0:5])
#And index is

#We count indexes by 0 is 1 and 1 is 2, so on, so forth
