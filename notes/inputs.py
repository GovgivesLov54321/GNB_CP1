# GNB - 1st - Inputs & Outputs Notes

#5 What is an input: A way for the code to get info

#6 What is the purpose of inputs: Code isn't helpful if it doesn't use new info
name = input("What's your name: ")
# 1  2   3             4
#  1 save input where it can be accessed again
#  2 use keyword "input"
#  3 inside parentheses give user instructions      

#Another way to do it:
#print("What's your name?")
#name = input
print("Nice to meet you,", name)
